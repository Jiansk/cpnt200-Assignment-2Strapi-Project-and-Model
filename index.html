  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <p>Reading this article makes me want to appreciate <strong>HTLM</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> more. Geoff Blake the author of this article talked about the history of HTML without CSS back in the day ...people demanded more from HTML demanding that it started doing things that it was not developed to do. Like text formatting, applying colours, and handling page layouts put a big strain on HTML. And after a while HTML (and web design overall) became very complex, bloated, and difficult to handle. But a solution was developed, and that solution was CSS. It  was developed specifically to take over all design and formatting duties. As an artist who loved to paint digitally i kinda understand when an important tool is missing... css is basically the same as the tools(brush, eraser, move tool,fill tool, bucket tool, etc.) i use to <strong>style</strong> when im painting using my computer and html is the sketches and the reference where the <strong>elements</strong> are. Without the tools its just a bunch of rough, unfinished drawings in the canvas. Its the same with html and css... CSS was developed specifically to take over all design and formatting duties. this article was written 4 years ago which is not that long ago, so i think it is still relevant by today. im pretty sure that some topics that is talked about in the article like the benefits css offers(can adjust your page layouts depending on where it's displayed,allows for rapid customization) is still very relevant by today. I found that the author is credible because he talks so much passion and knowledge about these web technologies in his youtube videos which is in the article above and while reading this article some information of what it says kind of makes sense because of what i learned in class.</p>
